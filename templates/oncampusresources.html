        On-Campus Resources for Support
    </h1>
    <p class="text-small">
        For these on-campus mental health care services, I have highlighted important information from their respective websites that may be relevant to those initially seeking care from these sources. This information, however, is not comprehensive. For more detailed information, please refer to their websites (linked below). In addition, it should be noted that many of these resources can also provide referrals for students for off-campus providers. Finally, I would like to state that I am not advocating for a specific resource or set of resources, I just want people to know where to find resources and options for support.

                            Princeton Peer Nightline is an anonymous peer listening service. Our listeners are  students of Princeton University who have been trained and certified as helpline volunteers. We provide empathetic, non-judgmental support to Princeton University students who wish to share a problem, are in need of information, or just want to talk about whatever is on their mind. Whether itâ€™s relationships, academic stress, a fight with a friend or parent, depression, eating disorders, suicidal thoughts, roommate troubles, or just a really bad day, weâ€™re here to listen and make sure that no student has to face their problems alone.

                            Peer Nightline volunteers do not provide professional counseling, but rather supportive listening. Students in crisis will be directed to appropriate professional resources including the CPS counselor on call. We highly recommend that students who are experiencing mental health emergencies reach out to the on-call counselor at CPS (609) 258-3141 or to Public Safety at (609) 258-1000.
